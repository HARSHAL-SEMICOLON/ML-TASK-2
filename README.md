# ML-TASK-2
Customer Segmentation with K-Means
This project uses K-Means clustering to group mall customers based on their annual income and spending score. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments for better targeting and marketing.

Steps:
Load and inspect the dataset (Mall_Customers.csv).
Select features: Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100).
Visualize customer distribution using a scatter plot.
Determine optimal clusters using the Elbow Method.
Apply K-Means with 5 clusters.
Plot results, showing customer segments and cluster centers.

Tools Used:
pandas, numpy – Data handling
matplotlib, seaborn – Visualization
scikit-learn – Clustering algorithm

This approach helps discover patterns in customer behavior without labeled data, aiding in personalized marketing strategies.
